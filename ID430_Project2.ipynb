    "    - You can create an illustrative poster of any size (preferrable larger than A3) that contains multiple static charts. Those charts do not need to be directly drawn with Plotly. Instead, you might want to redraw them with graphic tools (e.g. Illustrator, Figma) A good infographic should communicate not only factual findings but also a specific message for a specific group of people.  \n",

    "    - Like infographics, data videos might have clear communication goals. However, you may focus on animated chart elements and transitions between scenes.\n",
    "- Product\n",
    "    - You may propose a new product or a feature of an existing product(s) that employs charts that you create. To propose a product, you should design UI, which will be used by specific target users in a specific context.\n",
